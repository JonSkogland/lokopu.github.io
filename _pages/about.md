## About me

Hi, I'm *Jon Skogland*.

This is my personal page, where I share book review, learnings and  things that I pursue.

Currently, I'm working towards becoming a machine learning engineer through self-study. 

I've already completed two introductory coding courses through CS50 and I am now delving into the many topics of machine learning and data engineering.
