title: Day 12 - TicTacToe

Today I created tictactoe - with limitations.
I didn't get around to test human input properly.
You can't win through diagonals yet... I know it is possible with numpy, but didn't have the time.
Also if it is a tie, the program keeps running.

Code can be viewed [here ](https://github.com/JonSkogland/1000daysofcoding/blob/main/daily-projects/day12_20250622/day12.py).
