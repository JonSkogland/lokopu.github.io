For lack of inspiration today, I solved a challenge put forth on the internet: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8s0cy1/20180618_challenge_364_easy_create_a_dice_roller/

The goal was to create a dice rolling program that takes the input e.g. "2d10", meaning rolling 2 dice of 10 sides. Whereby the program will return the cumulative sum of the dice rolls.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day8_20250618/day8.py).
