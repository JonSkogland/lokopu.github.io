For lack of inspiration today, I solved a challenge put forth on the internet: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8s0cy1/20180618_challenge_364_easy_create_a_dice_roller/

The goal was to create a dice rolling program that takes the input e.g. "2d10", meaning rolling 2 dice of 10 sides. Whereby the program will return the cumulative sum of the dice rolls.

The code can be viewed here:
