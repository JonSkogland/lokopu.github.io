Today I wanted to try my hand at web scraping to improve my data fetching skills.

I did so by scraping all the name and addresses of Rema1000 stores across data and inserting them into a DataFrame.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day5_20250615/Rema1k.ipynb).
