title: Day 7 - Price optimization
date: 2025-06-17

Tried my hand at price optimization - although heavily based on this guide: https://medium.com/operations-research-bit/a-practical-guide-to-pricing-optimisation-using-machine-learning-5ec4bf7f0d4c - as I have never done price optimization before. 

The jupyter notebook can be viewed [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day7_20250617/day7.ipynb).
