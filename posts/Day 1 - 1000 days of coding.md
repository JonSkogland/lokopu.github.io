title: Day 1 - Linear regression on numerical data
date: 2025-06-11
---

Today marks the first day of a thousand days of coding.

Haven taken numerous certificates/courses in computer science and machine learning, I've come to the realisation (an obvious one at that) that nothing beats daily project based practice. 
Exercises from courses rarely cement themselves as it's easy to merely follow instructions without thoroughly problemsolving.

Today, day 1, I created a linear regression model on a dataset from Kaggle.
Although it's very minimal and not accurate at all, it is a good first.
