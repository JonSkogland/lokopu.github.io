title: Day 16 - Tracking of ISS on globe
date: 2025-06-27

See code [here](https://github.com/JonSkogland/1000daysofcoding/blob/main/daily-projects/day16_20250627/iss_location.py)

I didn't get around to clearning up the code and truly adding comments unfortunately. However, it gets the job done. 
I also wanted to make it automatic, so that the program would run every minute where you could slowly track the position of the ISS on the globe.
