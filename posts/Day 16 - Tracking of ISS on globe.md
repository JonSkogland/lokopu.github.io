See jupyter notebook [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day16_20250627/Day16.ipynb).

I didn't get around to clearning up the code and truly adding comments unfortunately. However, it gets the job done. 
I also wanted to make it automatic, so that the program would run every minute where you could slowly track the position of the ISS on the globe.
