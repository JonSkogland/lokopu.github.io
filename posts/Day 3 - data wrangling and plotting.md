title: Day 3 - data wrangling and plotting
date: 2025-06-13

Today I focused on using pandas and plotting using altair to improve those skills.
The dataset of the day is again from the economist and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/TheEconomist/banana-index-data/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)

Today was a bit easier compared to the previous days as they lack machine learning usage.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed here:
