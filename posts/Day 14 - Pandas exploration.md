Decided to dive deeper into pandas by exploration a data set from Kaggle.

Here I learned to "explode" column to expand columns of lists and then remove leading whitespace to effectively count categorical values.

See jupyter notebook [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day14_20250625/Day14.ipynb).
