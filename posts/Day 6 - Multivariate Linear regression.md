title: Day 6 - multivariate linear regression

Today I wanted to try multivariate linear regression

I did so by using a dataset from the book [Statistical Learning with Python](https://www.statlearning.com/), which included a few features of advertising expenditure in relation to sales figures.

The linear regression is however quite superficial, and does not go beyond fitting and evaluating model based on mean squared error, as I need to read through more text books on the subject to advance my machine learning skillset.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed [here](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/jonskogland-1000daysofcoding-tgi6eawy/lab/tree/daily-projects/day6_20250616/day6_advertising.ipynb).
