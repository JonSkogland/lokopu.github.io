Today I used a [dataset](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data/tree/master)from The Economist of big mac prices and GDP across countries.
I used this data to create a linear regression model to predict big mac prices based on GDP.

Again, like yesterday, I used Scikit-Learn  and their linear regression model. 
As I'm still new to this space, I used guidance and code from [this](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/regression2.html#linear-regression-in-python) data science book.
