# Experience
Overall, the Machine Learning Specialization course taught by Andrew Ng from Deeplearning.ai, was a good course, providing ample theoretical and mathematical background for the concepts within machine learning and showing you the implementations in Python. However, the exercises where not as useful as I had hoped. 
The course took around a month of 10-15 hours of studying a week to finish. 

## Structure
The course was well structured with clearly separated topics for each week. 
## Videos
The videos were simply in nature, and consisted of Andrew Ng showing Powerpoint slides with voiceover or speaking to the camera directly. His teaching style was calm, empathetic and encouraging. 
The lectures were easy to follow and all concepts were well explained.
## Exercises
as they do not require students to create machine learning algorithms from scratch but rather fill in select parts of algorithms. 
## Multiple-choice

## Math
It was a math heavy course with the focus being on the mathematical explanation of the machine learning algorithms. Key here being explanation, as the course does not require students to take the derivative of functions or calculate dot products by hand, as it was only required to know the functions in use and not necessarily how to get there.

## Statistics

## Programming

# Summary
Should you take it? If you are interested in machine learning and want to understand the theoretical foundations, then yes. If you primarily are looking to improve your machine learning coding skills, then no.
